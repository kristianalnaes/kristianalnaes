# Kristian Alnaes

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile. I mostly work for clients in private repositories, but use my personal github to keep tabs on interesting projects. And as a list of reminders to myself.

When I'm not at the computer I like to:

* Hike the outdoors
* Play and listen to music
* Challenge people to games

## Chief Technology Officer

I'm the current CTO of [TechPros AS](https://www.techpros.no) give us a call if you need help with any ML or Cloud projects!
